Software tracking common expenses.

## Rationale

Given a group of a few people, who often have common expenses, this software allows to track who paid for what and who owes how much money to whom.
The use is quite straightforward. For each expense:
1. Enter its cost
2. Indicate the persons who benefited of the expenses
3. Enter who paid for it
The amount of money is then equally divided for the beneficiaries of the expense, and added to or removed from their total.

Typical users for this application could be couples, groups of friends, shared flats, etc.


## History

This project started as a software for personal use and to get acquainted with QML.
